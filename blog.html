                    <br>
                    <p class="blog-paragraph"> 
                        They always tell CRM is saving your time and enhancing your business a lot and so many other
                        benefits. But does it really do?
                        In fact CRM may help a little in managing your relationship with customers, letting you get
                        reports in a more organized way and saving your customers data safely, but… who said that is
                        what your business really needs to succeed?
                        CRM companies are constantly competing to fit many industries at the same time. That makes each
                        tool has too many features which are not necessarily important to your pharma business. This
                        makes your sales team feel lost in the process, and makes the tools more complicated to use.
                        Even training, in that case, may not make much difference but wasting your time and money. If
                        the secret is not a CRM tool, then what your pharma business may really need? <br><br>

                        <h3 class="blog-text ">The secret is in the planning.</h3>

                        <p class="blog-paragraph">
                            It is true, Having the right plan with a clear direction and plain steps toward your goal
                            means
                            your business is already going along way. By talking about a plan here, I don’t mean your
                            digital presence or your whole marketing strategy, but only the part that covers your
                            medical
                            reps,their tasks and their daily activities. Looking at that area of the plan, all you need
                            to
                            make sure of is that your team reached its forecast, that they covered the whole list of
                            doctors
                            before the deadline. The key element of achieving that is to know already the requirements
                            of
                            the doctors on your list, the capabilities and the performance history of your medical reps
                            and
                            when is the right time to let these both meet each other. Seems too much to take care about,
                            especially if your business is already rowin, right?
                            Wrong! It is only too much if you still go through this process using papers, manually
                            filled
                            excel sheets and whatsapp for communication. Is there any other solution to be used?
                            <br><br> </p>

                        <h3 class="blog-text "> The secret is in the calling. </h3>

                        <p class="blog-paragraph">

                            Face-to-face meeting with your customers, it is all that matters in the sales process. If
                            your
                            customers buy the way you present your products, then no need to go on through this
                            paragraph.
                            No medical rep wants to be boring during a meeting with a potential customer. And paper
                            presentations are not the way to avoid that. In pharma industries, statistics, resources,
                            testimonials and every other small detail have a significant weight when talking to a
                            customer.
                            Balancing between all of those components parallel with observing how much your customer is
                            interested in what you say is really a tough task. Fortunately, it is tough only if you do
                            it
                            the old way: manually. Then, is there any other solution to do all of that in the right way?
                            <br><br> </p>

                        <h3 class="blog-text "> The secret is in the reporting.</h3>

                        <p class="blog-paragraph">
                        When the meeting is with HCP, you hardly know when or where the meeting will be. ِA medical rep
                        might have only a few minutes to talk and deliver the message. He needs to take the most benefit
                        of such a short meeting. Hence, the slightest remark of these calls should be recorded, reported
                        and analysed carefully. You don’t want to lose your data as it assesses the output of the next
                        meetings of this same type. So, reporting it through the classic channels: messages or phone
                        calls, may lead to false interpretations, missing data and it makes it harder to collect all the
                        data in one single report. This hassle needs to be ended, so you can focus on making the right
                        decision regarding your business growth instead of trying to collect the missing data. <br><br> </p>

                        <h3 class="blog-text "> The secret is in the analysis.</h3>


                   
                        <p class="blog-paragraph">
                        Making decisions like expansion or targeting new markets needs one to have a close look at the
                        current status of business. In some pharma businesses, collecting the market data and reporting
                        the latest detail of each product and HCP is still done manually and takes a lot of time to be
                        formed in one single report. analysis would include the status of each product, HCP, medical rep
                        and many other details. This may lead these pharma businesses to be left out of the competition.
                        In the meantime, other solutions are available, allowing your business to have a centralized
                        channel, accessed by you anytime/anywhere. This channel let the decision maker to see customized
                        analysis of the progress of the business in each area, with each medical rep and every single
                        product.<br><br> </p>

                        <h3 class="blog-text ">   It’s CLM, the secret.</h3>


                      
                        <p class="blog-paragraph">
                        It’s always beneficial to have some assessment in managing your pharma business. To have a
                        resource which gives you the sense of what may be a good decision and what would be a great
                        risk. To have a full image of your progress and the of where is the flaws in the sales process.
